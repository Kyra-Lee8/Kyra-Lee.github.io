			<div>
				<p>
			Vannevar Bush states in his article "As We May Think" that, "the world has arrived at an age of 
			cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it." 
			I think that Bush had an interesting perpective on photography and its relation to science. 
			He examines the different contexts at which we understand how 
			we can utilize photographs to interact with the developing technologies. 
			He in a sense makes his reader feels that they too are a scientists 
			whose view on the world is through the lenses of pictures.

		<h3 style="color:#FF3333;"> Paragraph 2 </h3>
			
			<div> 
				<p>
			In the text, "Long Live The Web", Tim Burners-Lee explains the evolution of the web and how it has played a significant role in the use of the Internet. He explains the seven key principles to making the web more valuable and goes through the different aspects of why making it more efficient is important. The protection of net neutrality has been in question since the creation of the web and Berners Lee states, "a neutral communications medium is the basis of a fair, competitive market economy, of democracy and of science. Debate has risen again in the past year about whether government legislation is needed to protect net neutrality." Due to an increase in undeertsanding of the web and the internet, the more concerns about privacy are raised. Tim Berners Lee has introduced many different stadpoints of the web's introduction, but he has reassured that "as long as the web's basic principles are upheld, it's ongoing revolution is not in the hands of any one person or organization neither mine nor anyone elses's. If we can preserve the principles, the Web promises some fantastic future capabilities."
