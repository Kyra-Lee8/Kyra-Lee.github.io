	<h1> Response to Image NET Roulette </h1>
	<div>
		<p>The New York Times Article, ‘Nerd’, ‘Nonsmoker’, ‘Wrongdoer’:How Might A.I. Label You?, brings awareness to the many biases and challenges associated with Artificial Intelligence. In my Management of Information, Technology and Systems course, we learned about the three types of A.I. and how they have developed over the course of time. The type of A.I. that was mentioned in the New York Times article was Cognitive Insight, otherwise known as deep learning.</p>

		<p>ImageNet Roulette is described as “a digital art project intended to shine a light on the quirky, unsound offensive behavior that can creep into the artificial intelligence technologies that are rapidly changing our everyday lives…” After interacting with the site, I realized that many of the concerns that were brought up in the article reveled itself. Some of the offensive and bias responses were reflected on my picture and words that were less offensive were shown on others. I then remembered that in the article, it stated that “in recent months, researchers have shown that face-recognition services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and IBM can be biased against women and people of color.” I fit into both of those categories. So it made me wonder, if these types of biases are reveled during an interactive site, I wonder how this applies to society. I also used a picture of my two favorite characters from "Law and Order:SVU" </p>

		<p>With everything that society is going through, it was not surprising to me that a site like Image NET Roulette was created. To me, it gives people the right to project there opinion onto someone else and judge them based on their own biases. When I chose the photographs I wanted to use, I did so because I wanted to see if these biases that I read about would actually happen, and to my non-surprise, they were true. This shows that artificial intelligence is on the rise and a lot of developing technologies may not serve in the best interest for everyone. </p>
