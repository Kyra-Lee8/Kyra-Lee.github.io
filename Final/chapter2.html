    <p>When it came to choosing a career, I had my mind set on becoming a Biomedical Engineer. I thought this was the path I was going to take, until I was denied from my dream school. Upon being accepted to NYU, I curated the term "Non-Traditional STEM".</p></div>

    <p>My major at NYU Tandon School of Engineering is "Business and Technology Management". Everytime I get asked, so what type of engineering is that, my response is always the same. It is not a traditional engineering discipline, it is non-traditional STEM. This means, I learn about what engineers do, without actually being the person to build the product. I help to make Engineers Lives easier. </p>

    <p>Being that I am in an Engineering school, but not a traditional engineering major, I decided to push myself and gain more knowledge of what different engineers do. I decided to join a Vertically Integrated Project called NYU Self Drive, where engineering students are building a self driving car. I brought my unique background of technology and management and I have now managed the team for One year. #STEMMActivist #engineering</p>

    <p> I have used this opportunity of being a Non Traditional STEM Major, to advocate for more youth to get involved in the business side of engineering. I joined the National Society of Black Engineers and have been involved since my freshman year of college. My role as Pre-Collegiate Initiative Chairperson allows me to encourage and advocate for youth.</p>
