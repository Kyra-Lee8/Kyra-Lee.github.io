		My name is Kyra-Lee.<br>I am a dedicated, passionate and persistent youth leader <br> with over 9 years of experience in leadership, public speaking and activism to name a few. <br> This has led to the creation of numerous events for over 900 youth across the globe. <br> This "book" is dedicated to anyone who is still on this journey called 'life'.<br>It can be challenging sometimes trying to find your passions and figure out life in general.<br> Hopefully, my story can serve as encouragement to never give up! <br> Once what you do comes from your heart, it will show. <br> #BePassionate #BePersistent #BeConfident #WhatIsYourStory </p>
