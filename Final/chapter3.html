    <p>I've been on this journey from since I was in the sixth grade. I started to learn more about what my mission, vision and purpose was. The question I had to ask myself was: what was I placed on this Earth to do that I am aware I can do and love to do?</p></div>

    <p>I am always in awe anytime I get the opportunity to speak to youth. It warms my heart and reminds me that all of what I am doing is much bigger than me. Being able to use my voice to encourage and advocate for youth has motivated me to never give up, keep on pushing and doing the best I can for those that look up to me. #KyraSpeaks #PublicSpeaker</p>

    <p>My 4-H Program has given me many opportunities to use my voice. For two consecutive years, I have moderated "National Youthe Science Day", a day dedicated for youth to engage in various STEM projects. I have been able to share my story of getting involved with STEM in hopes that it encourages a young person to explore the world of STEM too! #STEMMActivist #engineering</p>

    <p> Being the Youth Representative for Brooklyn Community Board 9, has granted me many opportunities to advoctae for youth programs in various communities and speak to different elected officials on how we can work together to implement change throughout the communities. I am thankful I was able to create a "Youth Voice Matters" video to encourage young people to let their voices be heard. #VOTE #KyraSpeaks</p>
