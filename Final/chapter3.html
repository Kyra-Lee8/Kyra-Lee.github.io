    <p>I've been on this journey from since I was in the sixth grade. I started to learn more about what my mission, vision and purpose was. The question I had to ask myself was: what was I placed on this Earth to do that I am aware I can do and love to do?</p></div>

    <p>At the age of five, I learned that both of my mother's lungs had collapsed. This event triggered something in me, as my dad always says, and I have made it my life's mission to make whatever I do in life have a positive effect on others. This deifning moment for me is how I found my voice. Programs like 4-H, helped me to understand how I can use my voice to make a larger impact. #KyraSpeaks #PublicSpeaker</p>
