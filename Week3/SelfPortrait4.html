			<div class="Youth">
		
			<p>From the age of five, I thought I wanted to become a <em>DOCTOR</em>, until I learned the word <em>ENGINEERING</em><br>
			I have always had a passion for math a science and now it reflects in the work that I do <br></p>
			<p>Exposing <em>YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY YOUTH OF COLOR</em> to <strong>STEM</strong>, is my motivation to continue. <br> I will continue to work hard, stay persistent, stay passionate, because I am <strong>LEADING BY EXAMPLE</strong></p>
